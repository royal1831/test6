Welcome to opsworks_ruby
========================

`opsworks_ruby`_ is a set of `chef`_ recipes to ease the deployment to `AWS OpsWorks`_ service. It was created, when
`Amazon introduced Chef 12 to OpsWorks stack`_ without support for any chef recipes. The main goal of this project is
to mimic Chef 11 OpsWorks stack as close as possible.

The code is open source, and `available on github`_.
